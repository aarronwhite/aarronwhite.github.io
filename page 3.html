<h1><u><FONT FACE="elephant">Frequently Visted Sites</u></FONT></h1>

<p> Being somebody who loves gaming, I'm constantly on the lookout for news and updates about the latest hardware and software releases. I visit most of these sites throughout the day everyday of the week without fail.
I like the look and feel of these sites which has been bringing me back to them for years, Eurogamer being one that has had a facelift recently which makes it alot more mobile friendly, which is good for me personally as it's the platform I browse these sites on mainly. </P>
<p> These are my top 5 sites </p>
