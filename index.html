<p> Hi there! Thanks for visiting, My names Aarron "Twiggy" White, I'm 29 years old <i>(approaching 30 *sigh*)</i> and currently Live in Dartford, Kent. You may be wondering what Twiggy is about, technically now it is my middle name by Law,
and has been a childhood nickname all my life.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2017 my life completely changed when I was accepted into a Software Development Apprenticeship at a freight forwarding company called Davies Turner. Here and during my course I'm learning the C# programming language with HTML/CSS/JQuery/Java/SQL all being part of what is used here.
It's been quite an eye opener really to finally see how software as we know it is made and maintained after going live.
It has been difficult and I'm well far away from the end goal, but it's something to work towards and with that in mind. I'll keep rolling with the punches.</p>
<h3><u><FONT FACE="elephant">Hobbies and Interests</u></FONT></h3>

<p> A major love of mine has always been gaming. Since a small boy i've always loved every single aspect of gaming which has progressed even more so as the years went on. I own most consoles old and new, but my major love has got to be PC Gaming.
I've had great joy of converting one of rooms in my house upstairs as a gaming shrine, which holds all sorts of gaming memoriblia aswell as my PC Gaming set up for which i've spent a good amount of money on, and every single penny has been worth it. </p>

<h4><u><FONT FACE="elephant">Websites I Frequently Visit</u></FONT></h4>
<p> Being somebody who loves gaming, I'm constantly on the lookout for news and updates about the latest hardware and software releases. I visit most of these sites throughout the day everyday of the week without fail.
I like the look and feel of these sites which has been bringing me back to them for years, Eurogamer being one that has had a facelift recently which makes it alot more mobile friendly, which is good for me personally as it's the platform I browse these sites on mainly. </P>
<p> These are my top 5 sites </p>
