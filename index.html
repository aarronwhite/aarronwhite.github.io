<p> Thanks for visiting, My names Aarron White, I'm 29 years old <i>(approaching 30 *sigh*)</i> and currently Live in Dartford, Kent and have done for the past 4 or so years.
I'm currently living engaged life to my Fiancee Amy. We've been together for about 9 years, which is a hell of a long time but we're still going strong.
</p>

<p>Towards the end of 2017 my life completely changed when I was accepted into a Software Development Apprenticeship at a freight forwarding company called Davies Turner. Here and during my course I'm learning the C# programming language with HTML/CSS/JQuery/Java/SQL all being part of what is used here.
It's been quite an eye opener really to finally see how software as we know it is made and maintained after going live.
It has been difficult and I'm well far away from the end goal, but it's something to work towards and with that in mind. I'll keep rolling with the punches.</p>
